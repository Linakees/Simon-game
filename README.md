This is an easy game, to train your memory.

By pressing any key, you start the game. The rules are:

Random plate is touched, it makes a sound. 

Now it's your turn. Press exactly the same button.

Now the second button is pressed. You shoud've memorized the first one, as at every new level you'll only be shown one new plate. 

But you need to pres all of them in the exact same order as they were pressed.

If you made a mistake, the game would be over.
